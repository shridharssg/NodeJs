Are there any disadvantages to using Node.js?
	Node.Js is not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. This is because Node.js is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one task at a time. Node.js is not suitable for applications that require a lot of memory. This is because Node.js uses a lot of memory for each connection. If you have a large number of connections, it can quickly consume a lot of memory.

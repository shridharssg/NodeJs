### What Is NodeJS

- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.
- A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

### Why NodeJS

- When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the file system, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back. This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs. 
- Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language

### Advantages of Node.js

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**
  
	- **Non-blocking I/O: Node**.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that allows it to handle multiple connections simultaneously. This makes it ideal for applications that require real-time interaction, such as chat applications or gaming servers.

	- **Efficient:** The asynchronous nature ensures that the server can process other requests while waiting for I/O operations to complete, leading to better resource utilization and efficiency.
Fast Execution

- **V8 Engine** :
 	Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript into machine code. This results in high performance and fast execution of code, making it suitable for data-intensive applications.
  
- **Single Programming Language**
	JavaScript for Everything: With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript on both the client and server sides. This unification simplifies the development process, allowing for better collaboration and code reuse.

- **Large Ecosystem**
	**npm**: The Node Package Manager (npm) provides access to a vast repository of reusable modules and libraries, which can accelerate development and reduce the need for writing code from scratch.

- **Scalability**
	Microservices Architecture: Node.js is well-suited for building scalable network applications. It supports the creation of microservices, which can be scaled independently, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the application.

- **Active Community and Support**
	Node.js has a large and active community, which contributes to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party tools. This makes it easier for developers to find solutions and support.

### Reasons to Choose Node.js or Best Projects to Use Node.js

- **Real-Time Applications**: If your project requires real-time capabilities, such as chat applications, collaborative tools, or online gaming, Node.js is a great choice due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

- **API development**: Node.js is an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs, thanks to its fast performance and support for JSON data
  
- **Single Language Stack**: For teams looking to unify their development stack with JavaScript across both front-end and back-end, Node.js offers a seamless integration.

- **Microservices:** Node.js’s scalability and support for microservices make it an excellent option for applications that need to handle a large number of simultaneous connections.

- **Data Streaming Applications**: Node.js is well-suited for applications that involve processing, analyzing, or transforming data streams in real-time. Its non-blocking I/O model and built-in support for streams make it efficient for handling large volumes of streaming data.

### Reasons to Avoid Node.js

- **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: If your application involves heavy computation or requires extensive use of CPU resources, Node.js may not be the best choice due to its single-threaded nature.

- **Complex Callbacks**: For developers new to asynchronous programming, managing callbacks can be challenging and may lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code.
  
- **Security Concerns**: If your project demands stringent security measures, the reliance on third-party modules in Node.js can pose risks. Rigorous security practices are essential to mitigate vulnerabilities.

- **Desktop Applications**: Node.js is primarily designed for server-side and web-based applications. If you’re building a desktop application, consider using other technologies specifically designed for desktop development, like Electron (which still uses Node.js under the hood but is a dedicated framework for desktop applications), or native development frameworks like Qt, .NET, or JavaFX.

### V8 Engine:

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on top of the Chrome V8 engine that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is known for its fast, event-driven, and non-blocking I/O model that makes it an ideal choice for building scalable, high-performance web applications.

The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It was first released in 2008 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript engines, powering not only Chrome but also Node.js and other JavaScript-based applications.

The V8 engine provides several features that make it ideal for building high-performance applications, including just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which compiles frequently executed code on the fly to improve performance, and a garbage collector that manages the memory used by the application.

The V8 engine compiles JavaScript code into machine code and executes it. It consists of several components, including a parser, an interpreter, a compiler, and a garbage collector.

When a JavaScript file is loaded in the browser or Node.js, the V8 engine first parses the code and then interpreter execute that code.

The interpreter executes the code line by line, converting each statement into machine code as it goes. However, interpreting code can be slow, especially when it involves complex calculations or loops.

To improve performance, the V8 engine also includes a compiler that can optimize frequently executed code on the fly. The compiler analyzes the code and generates more efficient machine code, reducing the time it takes to execute the code.

The V8 engine also includes a garbage collector that manages the memory used by the application. When an object is no longer needed, the garbage collector frees up the memory it was using, preventing memory leaks and other issues that can slow down an application.

### Libuv

Libuv is a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library used by Node.js for handling I/O operations on different operating systems. 

Libuv provides an event-driven programming model for I/O operations, which means that it uses callbacks to handle events such as data received or a connection established. This allows Node.js to perform I/O operations without blocking the main event loop, which can significantly improve the performance of I/O-bound applications.

**Some of the key features of libuv include:**

- **Asynchronous File System Access**: Libuv provides asynchronous file system access, allowing Node.js to perform file operations without blocking the main event loop.

- **Network I/O**: Libuv also provides asynchronous network I/O operations, allowing Node.js to create and manage network connections without blocking the main event loop.

- **Thread Pool**: Libuv includes a thread pool for performing blocking operations such as cryptographic operations or database queries. The thread pool allows these operations to be executed asynchronously, without blocking the main event loop.  	

- **Timer Management**: Libuv provides timer management for scheduling callbacks at specific times. This allows Node.js to perform time-based operations without blocking the main event loop.

Libuv is a critical component of Node.js, and it is responsible for managing most of the I/O operations performed by Node.js applications. It is a highly performant library that has been optimized to work efficiently on a variety of platforms, making it an essential part of the Node.js ecosystem.

### Libuv Thread Pool

**Thread Pool**: Libuv includes a thread pool for performing blocking operations such as cryptographic operations or database queries. The thread pool allows these operations to be executed asynchronously, without blocking the main event loop.

Libuv initiates a thread pool of 4 threads . we are allowed to change the default value of 4 threads to anything up to 1024 threads. We achieve this by setting the **UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE** Node variable.
  
**Physical vs Logical CPU Cores**
To better understand what to set the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to, we need to first understand how many logical cores our machine is running. If we take MacBook Pro as an example, it’s running 6 Physical CPU cores (Intel).

However, these cores have hyperthreading, which means that each core can run 2 operations simultaneously. We therefore regard 1 physical core with hyperthreading as 2 logical cores. In my case, my MacBook Pro is running 12 logical cores.

**How To Increase Node JS Performance**
The recommendation is to set the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE to the number of logical cores your machine is running. In my case I will set the thread pool size to 12.

It makes no sense setting the size to anything more than the logical cores your hardware is running and could actually result in poorer performance.

**How To Check For Logical Cores**
When it comes to deployment, the last thing you want to do is manually set the UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE, as your app might run on multiple environments with different machine specifications. As such, we need a way to dynamically set the thread pool size the moment the app is launched on the relevant environment.

```
const OS = require('os')
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = OS.cpus().length
```

The OS module is native to Node JS. It has a function cpus(), which returns the total amount of logical cores your machine is running. What’s nice is, should your CPU cores not have hyperthreading, this function will just return the number of physical cpu cores instead, which is perfect.

### Synchronous : 
 Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.
```
console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');

o/p :

First
Second
Third
```

First, console.log('First') goes into the stack, executes, and pops out. Then console.log('Second') does the same, and finally console.log('Third'). 
After that, the stack is empty, with nothing else to execute.

### Asynchronous
As we saw in the synchronous code example, all instructions in the program execute one after another, and every instruction waits for its previous instruction to get executed. Due to this nature of synchronous programming, sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the user interface. Asynchronous code execution allows to execution next instructions immediately and doesn’t block the flow because of previous instructions.

```
console.log('First');

// Set timeout for 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => console.log('Second'), 2000);

console.log('Third');

o/p :

First
Third
Second
```
Third gets printed before Second, because of the asynchronous execution of the code. Here setTimeout() function waits for 2 seconds, and in the meantime, the next instruction gets executed without waiting for the previous one to complete the execution.

Asynchronous operations in JavaScript are carried out by using - callback functions, promises, and async-await.

### Non-blocking I/O

Non-blocking I/O is a fundamental concept in Node.js that enables it to achieve high performance and scalability. It refers to the ability of a program to perform I/O operations without blocking the main event loop or other threads.

Traditional I/O operations are blocking, meaning that when a program performs an I/O operation such as reading from a file or making a network request, it waits for the operation to complete before continuing with other tasks. This can lead to performance issues when dealing with I/O-bound applications, as the program can become unresponsive while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

In Node.js, I/O operations are designed to be non-blocking, meaning that they execute in the background while the program continues with other tasks. This is achieved through the use of callbacks and the event loop, which constantly listens for events and executes associated callbacks when they occur.

When a non-blocking I/O operation is initiated, it is added to a queue, and when the operation completes, its callback is added to another queue. The event loop constantly checks these queues and executes any pending callbacks, allowing the program to continue with other tasks while I/O operations are performed in the background.

Non-blocking I/O is essential for building scalable and high-performance applications in Node.js. By allowing programs to perform I/O operations asynchronously, without blocking the main event loop, Node.js can handle large numbers of connections and I/O operations with minimal overhead.

### What is Express.js and Why Should We Use?

Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web application framework built on top of Node.js, used for creating web applications and APIs. It extends the web server capabilities of Node.js and provides a set of features to easily handle HTTP requests.

First of all, yes we can write our backend using just Node. However, when we use Express.js, we can handle it in a more readable and writable, modular way. 
Additionally, it makes managing our backend easier because Express.js allows us to use predefined methods (such as GET, POST, etc.) and routes to route and process HTTP requests, which ensures that the code is more organized.

But, how does Express.js increase the readability and writability? I have some easy examples for you:

```
in Node JS

const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const path = url.parse(req.url).pathname;
  
  if (path === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('home.');
  } else if (path === '/about') {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('about me.');
  } else if (path === '/contact') {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('contact me.');
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('404 Not Found');
  }
});

const port = 3000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`server started on port ${port}.`);
});

```
```
in ExpressJS

import  express  from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("home.")
})

app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
    res.send("about me.")
})

app.get("/contact", (req, res) => {
    res.send("contact me.")
})

app.listen(port, ()=>{
    console.log("server started on port 3000.");
})
```
As you can see, by using Express.js, our code changed dramatically. Also, the code is working the same as before

**middleware**
Additionally, by using Express.js’s middleware system, you can make operations more modular and further clean up your code. For instance, you can easily add functionalities such as session management, security checks, and data processing on requests.

### Token-based authentication and session-based authentication

Token-based authentication and session-based authentication are two different approaches to managing user authentication. Here's a comparison:
 
*Token-Based Authentication*
 
1. _Stateless_: Server doesn't store user session information.
2. _Tokens_: Client receives a token (e.g., JWT) after authentication.
3. _Token verification_: Server verifies token on each request.
4. _No session storage_: No server-side session storage required.
5. _Scalability_: Better scalability since no session storage needed.
6. _Security_: Tokens can be signed and encrypted for added security.
 
*Session-Based Authentication*
 
1. _Stateful_: Server stores user session information.
2. _Session ID_: Client receives a session ID after authentication.
3. _Session storage_: Server stores session data (e.g., user ID, permissions).
4. _Session verification_: Server verifies session ID on each request.
5. _Server-side storage_: Requires server-side session storage.
6. _Security_: Sessions can be vulnerable to attacks (e.g., session fixation).
 
Key differences:
 
- Token-based authentication is stateless, while session-based authentication is stateful.
- Token-based authentication uses tokens for verification, while session-based authentication uses session IDs.
- Token-based authentication is more scalable and secure, while session-based authentication can be more vulnerable to attacks.
 
When to use each:
 
- Token-based authentication:
    - API authentication
    - Mobile app authentication
    - Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Session-based authentication:
    - Traditional web applications
    - Applications requiring server-side session management
 
Remember, token-based authentication is generally more modern and secure, but session-based authentication can still be suitable for certain use cases.

### To prevent Node.js from continuously hitting an API or malacious attack, you can implement the following strategies:
### Or How to increase application performance

To prevent Node.js from continuously hitting an API, you can implement the following strategies:
 
1. *Rate Limiting*: 
               Set a limit on the number of requests made to the API within a certain time frame. Use libraries like `rate-limiter-flexible` or `limiter` to achieve this. **or**
               Slows down responses rather than blocking them outright. Use to slow repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset. Use libraries like 'express-slow-down' to achieve this.
 
2. **Caching**: Cache API responses in memory or a database to reduce the number of requests made. Use libraries like `node-cache` or `redis`.
 
3. **Debouncing**: Group multiple requests into a single request using debouncing techniques. Use libraries like `lodash.debounce` or `debounce`.
 
4. **Throttling**: Limit the number of requests made within a certain time frame. Use libraries like `throttle-debounce` or `p-throttle`.
 
5. ***Exponential Backoff***: Gradually increase the delay between requests after each failure. Use libraries like `backoff` or `retry-axios`.
 
6. ***Circuit Breaker Pattern***: Temporarily stop making requests when the API is down or responding with errors. Use libraries like `opossum` or `circuit-breaker-js`.
 
7. ***API Keys or Tokens***: Use API keys or tokens to authenticate and limit requests. Check with the API provider for their usage guidelines.
 
8. ***Request Queueing***: Queue requests and process them in batches to reduce the load on the API.
 
9. ***Monitor API Usage***: Keep an eye on API usage metrics to detect and prevent excessive requests.
 
10. ***Implement API Provider Guidelines***: Follow the guidelines and limits set by the API provider to avoid abuse and termination of service.
 
By implementing these strategies, you can prevent Node.js from continuously hitting an API and ensure a more reliable and efficient application.

## Rate limiting
https://blog.appsignal.com/2024/04/03/how-to-implement-rate-limiting-in-express-for-nodejs.html

Rate limiting is a fundamental mechanism for controlling the number of requests a client can make to a server in a given time frame

Rate limiting is a strategy for limiting network traffic by placing a cap on how often an actor can call the same API in a given time frame. That's essential for controlling the volume of requests a client can make to a server in a certain amount of time.

To better understand how this mechanism works, consider a scenario where you have a Node.js backend that exposes some public endpoints. Suppose a malicious user targets your server and writes a simple script to overload it with automated requests. The performance of your server will downgrade as a result, hindering the experience of all other users. In an extreme situation, your server may even go offline. By limiting the number of requests the same IP can make in a given time frame, you can avoid all that!

Specifically, there are two approaches to rate limiting:

**Blocking incoming requests:** When a client exceeds the defined limits, deny its additional requests.

**Slowing down requests:** Introduce a delay for requests beyond the limits, making the caller wait longer and longer for a response.

controlling the rate at which requests are processed helps enforce usage limits, prevents server overloads, and safeguards against malicious attacks.

### Blocking incoming requests

```
const express = require("express");

const port = 3000;

// initialize an Express server
const app = express();

// define a sample endpoint
app.get("/hello-world", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

// start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://hostname:${port}`);
});

```

 How to integrate rate limiting behavior into a Node.js application using the following libraries:

**express-rate-limit:** To block requests that exceed specified limits.

**express-slow-down:** To slow down similar requests coming from the same actor.

```

const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  limit: 10, // maximum number of requests allowed in the windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests, please try again later.',
});

// option 1 : Register the limiter middleware to all endpoints with:

   app.use(limiter);

// option 2 : If you instead want to rate limit APIs under a specific path, use the limiter middleware as below:

   app.use("/public", limiter);

// option 3 : To protect only a certain endpoint, pass limiter as a parameter in the endpoint definition:

   app.get("/hello-world", limiter, (req, res) => {
     // ...
   });

```

Testing Rate Limiting

Open the postman and test it.
On the eleventh API call within a 1-minute time frame, the request will fail, with the error: “Too many requests, please try again later.”


### Slowing Down Requests With express-slow-down

```
const { rateLimit } = require("express-slow-down");

const limiter = slowDown({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  delayAfter: 10, // allow 10 requests per `windowMs` (5 minutes) without slowing them down
  delayMs: (hits) => hits * 200, // add 200 ms of delay to every request after the 10th
  maxDelayMs: 5000, // max global delay of 5 seconds
});

app.use(limiter);       // or other option which mentioned in above example

```

## Debounce and Throttling
https://medium.com/@bs903944/debounce-and-throttling-what-they-are-and-when-to-use-them-eadd272fe0be

If you are a web developer, you might have encountered situations where you need to optimize the performance of your code that runs repeatedly within a short period of time. For example, you might have a search bar that fetches suggestions from the backend as the user types, or a resize event handler that adjusts the layout of your page. In these cases, you don’t want to execute your code too often, as it might cause unnecessary network requests, a laggy user interface, or high CPU usage.

To solve this problem, you can use two techniques called debouncing and throttling. These techniques allow you to control the rate at which your code is executed, and reduce the number of times it is called.

### What is Debouncing?
Debouncing is a technique that delays the execution of a function until the user stops performing a certain action for a specified amount of time. For example, if you have a search bar that fetches suggestions from the backend as the user types, you can debounce the function that makes the API call, so that it only runs after the user stops typing for a few seconds. This way, you can avoid making too many API calls that might overload your server or return irrelevant results.

To implement debouncing in JavaScript, you can use a timer variable to track the delay period. You can use the setTimeout function to set a timer that will execute your function after the delay period. You can also use the clearTimeout function to cancel the timer if the user performs the action again before the delay period ends. This way, you can ensure that your function only runs once after the user stops performing the action.

Here is an example of how to implement debouncing in JavaScript:

```
  // A function that makes an API call with the search query
  function searchHandler(query) {
      // Make an API call with search query
      getSearchResults(query);
  }
  // A debounce function that takes a function and a delay as parameters
  function debounce(func, delay) {
      // A timer variable to track the delay period
      let timer;
      // Return a function that takes arguments
      return function(…args) {
          // Clear the previous timer if any
          clearTimeout(timer);
          // Set a new timer that will execute the function after the delay period
          timer = setTimeout(() => {
              // Apply the function with arguments
              func.apply(this, args);
          }, delay);
      };
  }
  // A debounced version of the search handler with 500ms delay
  const debouncedSearchHandler = debounce(searchHandler, 500);
  // Add an event listener to the search bar input
  searchBar.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
      // Get the value of the input
      const query = event.target.value;
      // Call the debounced search handler with the query
      debouncedSearchHandler(query);
  });

```
In this example, we have a searchHandler function that makes an API call with the search query. We also have a debounce function that takes a function and a delay as parameters, and returns a debounced version of that function. We use this debounce function to create a debouncedSearchHandler function with 500ms delay. We then add an event listener to the search bar input, and call the debouncedSearchHandler function with the input value. This way, we can ensure that we only make one API call after the user stops typing for 500ms.

## What is Throttling?

Throttling is a technique that limits the execution of a function to once in every specified time interval. For example, if you have a resize event handler that adjusts the layout of your page, you can throttle the function that updates the layout, so that it only runs once every 100ms. This way, you can avoid running your code too frequently, which might cause janky user interface or high CPU usage.

To implement throttling in JavaScript, you can use a flag variable to track whether the function is already running or not. You can use the setTimeout function to set a timer that will reset the flag after the time interval. You can also use an if statement to check whether the flag is true or not before executing your function. This way, you can ensure that your function only runs once in every time interval.

Here is an example of how to implement throttling in JavaScript:

 ```
    // A function that updates the layout of the page
    function updateLayout() {
        // Update layout logic
    }
    // A throttle function that takes a function and an interval as parameters
    function throttle(func, interval) {
        // A flag variable to track whether the function is running or not
        let isRunning = false;
        // Return a function that takes arguments
        return function(…args) {
            // If the function is not running
            if (!isRunning) {
                // Set the flag to true
                isRunning = true;
                // Apply the function with arguments
                func.apply(this, args);
                // Set a timer that will reset the flag after the interval
                setTimeout(() => {
                    // Set the flag to false
                    isRunning = false;
                }, interval);
            }
        };
    }
    // A throttled version of the update layout function with 100ms interval
    const throttledUpdateLayout = throttle(updateLayout, 100);
    // Add an event listener to the window resize event
    window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
        // Call the throttled update layout function
        throttledUpdateLayout();
    });
 ```

In this example, we have an updateLayout function that updates the layout of the page. We also have a throttle function that takes a function and an interval as parameters, and returns a throttled version of that function. We use this throttle function to create a throttledUpdateLayout function with 100ms interval. We then add an event listener to the window resize event, and call the throttledUpdateLayout function. This way, we can ensure that we only update the layout once every 100ms.

## What is the Difference Between Debouncing and Throttling?

The main difference between debouncing and throttling is that debouncing executes the function only after some cooling period, while throttling executes the function at a regular interval. Debouncing and throttling are both useful techniques to improve the performance of your code, but they have different use cases and effects.

Debouncing is useful when you want to delay the execution of your code until the user stops performing a certain action. For example, you can use debouncing for autocomplete, where you want to wait for the user to stop typing before fetching suggestions from the backend. Debouncing can reduce the number of times your code is executed, but it can also introduce some latency in your user interface.

Throttling is useful when you want to limit the execution of your code to a certain frequency. For example, you can use throttling for resize, where you want to update the layout of your page at a fixed rate. Throttling can improve the responsiveness of your user interface, but it can also cause some loss of information or accuracy in your code.

## How to remove unused libraries or modules in a Node.js application, 

follow these steps:
 
1. *Identify unused dependencies*:
    - Use tools like `depcheck` or `unused-deps` to scan your project and identify unused dependencies.
    - Run `depcheck` or `unused-deps` in your terminal/command prompt to get a list of unused dependencies.
2. *Remove unused dependencies from `package.json`*:
    - Open your `package.json` file and remove the unused dependencies from the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section.
3. *Remove unused modules from your code*:
    - Search for `require` or `import` statements in your code that reference the unused modules.
    - Remove or comment out these statements to prevent the modules from being loaded.
4. *Run `npm prune` or `yarn prune`*:
    - Run `npm prune` or `yarn prune` to remove unused dependencies from your `node_modules` directory.
5. *Verify and test*:
    - Verify that your application still works as expected after removing unused dependencies.
    - Run tests to ensure that removing unused dependencies didn't break any functionality.
 
Some popular tools to help you identify and remove unused dependencies include:
 
- `depcheck`: A command-line tool to check for unused dependencies.
- `unused-deps`: A tool to identify unused dependencies in your project.
- `npm-unused`: A tool to identify and remove unused dependencies.
- `yarn unused`: A command to identify unused dependencies in your project.

```
npm install depcheck

for run 
depcheck /path/to/my/project

output :

Unused dependencies
* underscore
Unused devDependencies
* jasmine
Missing dependencies
* lodash

```
The **dependency underscore** is declared in the package.json file, but not used by any code.
The **devDependency jasmine** is declared in the package.json file, but not used by any code.
The **dependency lodash** is used somewhere in the code, but not declared in the package.json file.

Please note that, if a subfolder has a package.json file, it is considered another project and should be checked with another depcheck command.
Remember to always verify and test your application after removing unused dependencies to ensure that everything works as expected.

### ACL - Access Control List : role-based access control

ACL stands for Access Control List, which is a mechanism used to manage permissions and access to resources in a system. In Node.js, ACL can be implemented using various libraries and frameworks, such as:
 
1. acl (npm package): A popular library for managing ACL in Node.js applications.
2. access-control (npm package): Another library for implementing ACL in Node.js.
3. Node-ACL (npm package): A simple ACL library for Node.js.
4. CASL (npm package): A more advanced library for managing permissions and ACL in Node.js applications.
 
These libraries provide features like role-based access control, permission management, and more.

To implement API-specific permissions, you can modify the `allows` property to include specific API endpoints and HTTP methods. Here's an updated example:

In below example:
- We define three roles: `admin`, `moderator`, and `user`.
- The `admin` role has full access to both `/api/users` and `/api/posts`.
- The `moderator` role can `GET`, `POST`, and `PUT` on `/api/posts`, but not `DELETE`.
- The `user` role can only `GET` and `POST` on `/api/posts`.
- We specify the permissions for each role using the `allows` property.
- We then check if a specific role has permission to perform an action on a resource using the `isAllowed` method.
- By separating the permission-checking logic into its own middleware function (`checkPermissions`), you can easily reuse it across multiple routes or even in other parts of your application.

```
const express = require('express');
const acl = require('acl');
 
const app = express();
 
// Initialize ACL
const aclInstance = new acl(new acl.memoryBackend());
 
// Define roles and permissions
aclInstance.allow([
  {
    roles: 'admin',
    allows: [
      { resources: '/api/users', permissions: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'] },
      { resources: '/api/posts', permissions: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'] }
    ]
  },
  {
    roles: 'moderator',
    allows: [
      { resources: '/api/posts', permissions: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT'] }
    ]
  },
  {
    roles: 'user',
    allows: [
      { resources: '/api/posts', permissions: ['GET', 'POST'] }
    ]
  }
]);
 
// Separate middleware function to check permissions

const checkPermissions = (req, res, next) => {
  const role = req.user.role; // Assuming you have a way to get the user's role
  const resource = req.path;
  const method = req.method;
 
  aclInstance.isAllowed(role, resource, method, (err, allowed) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(500).send({ message: 'Internal Server Error' });
    }
 
    if (!allowed) {
      return res.status(403).send({ message: 'Access denied' });
    }
 
    next();
  });
};
 
    // Use the middleware function in the app
app.use(checkPermissions);
 
   // API routes
app.post('/api/posts', (req, res) => {
  // Handle POST request
});
 
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

### how to encrypt user requests and server responses in Node.js using AES encryption:

Here's an example of how to encrypt user requests and server responses in Node.js using AES encryption:
 
***Client-side (encrypting request payload)***

```
const crypto = require('crypto-js');
 
// User data to be sent
const userData = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'johndoe@example.com' };
 
// Encrypt user data with AES
const encryptedData = crypto.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(userData), 'secretKey').toString();
 
// Send encrypted data to server
fetch('/user-data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: encryptedData,
});

```
***Server-side (decrypting request payload and encrypting response)***

```
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto-js');
 
const app = express();
 
app.post('/user-data', (req, res) => {
  // Decrypt request payload
  const decryptedData = crypto.AES.decrypt(req.body, 'secretKey').toString(crypto.enc.Utf8);
 
  // Parse decrypted data
  const userData = JSON.parse(decryptedData);
 
  // Process user data...
 
  // Encrypt response data
  const response = { message: 'User data received successfully' };
  const encryptedResponse = crypto.AES.encrypt(JSON.stringify(response), 'secretKey').toString();
 
  // Send encrypted response
  res.send(encryptedResponse);
});
```
In this example, we use the `crypto-js` library to encrypt and decrypt data using AES encryption. The client encrypts the user data before sending it to the server, and the server decrypts the data upon receiving it. The server then encrypts the response data before sending it back to the client.
 
Note that you should replace `'secretKey'` with a secure random key, and store it securely on both the client and server.

### Encryption techniques used in Angular and Node to send data securely:
 
**Angular**:
 
1. *HTTPS*: Use HTTPS protocol to encrypt data in transit.
2. *TLS*: Implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure data transmission.
3. *Hashing*: Use libraries like bcrypt to hash sensitive data before sending.
4. *Encryption libraries*: Utilize libraries like crypto-js or angular-encryption to encrypt data.
 
**Node**:
 
1. *HTTPS*: Use HTTPS protocol to encrypt data in transit.
2. *TLS/SSL*: Implement Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) to secure data transmission.
3. *Crypto module*: Leverage Node's built-in crypto module for encryption and decryption.
4. *Hashing libraries*: Use libraries like bcrypt or hash.js to hash sensitive data.
5. *Encryption libraries*: Utilize libraries like crypto-js or node-encryption to encrypt data.
 
**Common techniques:**
 
1. *JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*: Use JWT to securely transmit data between Angular and Node.
2. *OAuth*: Implement OAuth protocol for secure authentication and data transmission.
3. *Public-Key Cryptography*: Use public-key cryptography (e.g., RSA) to encrypt data.
 
Remember to always validate and sanitize user input data to prevent security vulnerabilities.
 
---

### Hashing  vs Encryption

Here's a clear explanation of the difference between hashing and encryption:

***Hashing:***

1. *One-way process*: Hashing is a one-way process that transforms data into a fixed-length string of characters (hash value).

2. *Irreversible*: Hashing is irreversible, meaning it's impossible to retrieve the original data from the hash value.

3. *Fixed output size*: Hash values have a fixed length, regardless of the input data size.

4. *Data integrity*: Hashing is used to ensure data integrity, detecting changes or tampering.

5. *Examples*: SHA-256, MD5, bcrypt

***Encryption:***
1. *Two-way process*: Encryption is a two-way process that transforms data into a ciphertext (encrypted data) and can be decrypted back to the original data.

2. *Reversible*: Encryption is reversible, allowing the original data to be retrieved from the ciphertext.

3. *Variable output size*: Encrypted data can have a variable length, depending on the input data size and encryption algorithm.

4. *Data confidentiality*: Encryption is used to ensure data confidentiality, protecting it from unauthorized access.

5. *Examples*: AES, RSA, TLS

**In summary:**

- Hashing is for data integrity and authenticity, making it impossible to retrieve the original data.

- Encryption is for data confidentiality, allowing the original data to be retrieved with the correct decryption key.

### Hashing

Hashing is used to store passwords securely in Node.js (and in general) because it's a one-way process, making it difficult for attackers to obtain the original password. Here's why:
 
1. *Password storage*: When a user creates an account, their password is hashed and stored in the database.
2. *Verification*: When the user logs in, their input password is hashed and compared to the stored hash.
3. *Matching hashes*: If the two hashes match, the user is authenticated.
 
Using hashing for password storage provides several benefits:
 
1. *Protection against data breaches*: Even if an attacker gains access to the database, they'll only obtain the hashed passwords, making it difficult to obtain the original passwords.
2. *Password confidentiality*: Hashing ensures that even the system administrators cannot access the original passwords.
3. *Password integrity*: Hashing helps detect password tampering or unauthorized changes.
 
To further enhance security, additional measures are often used in conjunction with hashing:
 
1. *Salting*: Adding a random value (salt) to the password before hashing, making it more resistant to rainbow table attacks.

1. *Salting*: Adding a random value (salt) to the password before hashing, making it more resistant to rainbow table attacks.
2. *Multiple iterations*: Repeating the hashing process multiple times (e.g., bcrypt) to slow down the hashing process, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
3. *Key stretching*: Using algorithms like PBKDF2 or Argon2, which are designed to be slow and computationally expensive, making them more resistant to attacks.
 
**Salting**
 
1. *Prevents Rainbow Table Attacks*: Rainbow tables are precomputed tables of hash values for common passwords. Salting makes it difficult for attackers to use rainbow tables, as the salt value is unique for each user.
2. *Makes Hashes Unique*: Even if two users have the same password, the salted hashes will be different, making it harder for attackers to identify duplicate passwords.
3. *Increases Hash Length*: Salting increases the length of the hash, making it more resistant to collisions (where two different inputs produce the same hash).
4. *Slows Down Hashing*: Salting can slow down the hashing process, making it more resistant to brute-force attacks.
5. *Makes Hashes Less Predictable*: Salting makes it harder for attackers to predict the hash value, even if they know the password.
 
**In the example above, salting is used to add an extra layer of security to the password hashing process. The salt value is randomly generated and stored along with the hashed password. When the user logs in, the salt value is used to hash the input password, and the resulting hash is compared to the stored hash.**

**Example**
 
1. User creates an account with password "mysecretpassword"
2. Generate a random salt value (e.g., "abc123")
3. Hash the password with the salt value: `hash("mysecretpassword" + "abc123")`
4. Store the resulting hash value (e.g., "hashedpassword123") and the salt value ("abc123") in the database
 
**When the user logs in:**
 
1. Retrieve the stored salt value ("abc123")
2. Hash the input password with the salt value: `hash("mysecretpassword" + "abc123")`
3. Compare the resulting hash value to the stored hash value ("hashedpassword123")
 
If the two hash values match, the user is authenticated.
 
**In summary, hashing is used to store passwords securely because it's a one-way process that makes it difficult for attackers to obtain the original password, while still allowing for verification and authentication.**

### To handle a scenario where a single API is down, but the client is still making requests to it, you can implement the following strategies in Node.js:
 
1. *Circuit Breaker Pattern*: Use a library like `opossum` or `circuit-breaker-js` to detect when the API is down and prevent further requests until it's back up.
2. *Retry Mechanism*: Implement a retry mechanism using a library like `retry-axios` or `p-retry` to retry the request after a certain amount of time.
3. *Fallback API*: Provide a fallback API or a default response when the primary API is down.
4. *Load Balancing*: Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the API, so if one instance is down, the other instances can handle the requests.
5. *Monitoring and Alerting*: Monitor the API's health and set up alerts to notify the development team when the API is down.
6. *Graceful Degradation*: Design the system to degrade gracefully, so even if the API is down, the system can still function, albeit with reduced functionality.

Let's consider an example of a Node.js application that handles a user's GET request to retrieve their profile information. We'll use the `express` framework to handle the request and `axios` to make an API request to an external service.
 
**_Without Retry Mechanism_**

```
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
 
const app = express();
 
app.get('/user/profile', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('(link unavailable)');
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to retrieve profile information' });
  }
});
```
In this example, if the API request to the external service fails (e.g., due to a network error or the external service being down), the application will return a 500 error response to the user.
 
**_With Retry Mechanism using `p-retry`_**
```
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const pRetry = require('p-retry');
 
const app = express();
 
app.get('/user/profile', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response = await pRetry(() => axios.get('(link unavailable)'), {
      retries: 3,
      minTimeout: 1000,
      maxTimeout: 5000,
    });
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to retrieve profile information' });
  }
});
```

In this example, we've wrapped the `axios.get` request in a `pRetry` function. If the request fails, `pRetry` will automatically retry the request up to 3 times, with a minimum timeout of 1 second and a maximum timeout of 5 seconds. If all retries fail, the application will return a 500 error response to the user.
 
By using a retry mechanism, we can make our application more resilient to temporary failures and improve the overall user experience. If the external service is temporarily down, our application will retry the request and potentially succeed on a subsequent attempt, rather than immediately returning an error to the user.

### Axios

Axios is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Node.js because of its:
 
1. *Simple and intuitive API*: Axios has a straightforward API that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and interact with web servers.
 
2. *Promise-based*: Axios uses Promises, which makes it easy to handle asynchronous requests and errors.
 
3. *Support for async/await*: Axios works seamlessly with async/await syntax, making it easy to write asynchronous code that's easy to read and maintain.
 
4. *Interceptors*: Axios allows you to intercept requests and responses, making it easy to add custom logic, headers, or error handling.
 
5. *Cancel requests*: Axios allows you to cancel ongoing requests, which is useful for handling timeouts or user-initiated cancellations.
 
6. *JSON data handling*: Axios automatically converts JSON data to JavaScript objects, making it easy to work with JSON APIs.
 
7. *Error handling*: Axios provides detailed error messages and codes, making it easy to handle and debug errors.
 
8. *Lightweight*: Axios is a lightweight library, making it suitable for use in serverless environments or applications with limited resources.
 
Overall, Axios provides a convenient, flexible, and powerful way to make HTTP requests in Node.js, making it a popular choice among developers.

Here's an example of using Axios to make a GET request to a JSON API:
 
```
in backendd
const axios = require('axios');
 
async function fetchUserData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('(link unavailable)');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
 
fetchUserData();
```
 
In this example:
 
- We import Axios and create an async function `fetchUserData`.
- Inside the function, we use `axios.get` to make a GET request to the specified URL.
- We await the response and log the data to the console.
- If an error occurs, we catch it and log the error to the console.
 
This is a simple example, but Axios can handle more complex scenarios, such as:
 
- Posting data to an API
- Handling authentication and headers
- Canceling requests
- Intercepting requests and responses
 
**Axios can be used in both Angular and Node.js.**
 
*In Angular:* Axios is used as a client-side HTTP client to make requests to servers. 
 
*In Node.js:* Axios is used as a server-side HTTP client to make requests to other servers or APIs. It's often used to:
              In Node.js, Axios is typically used in server-side code, such as in Express.js routes or middleware.
 
In summary, Axios can be used in both Angular and Node.js to make HTTP requests, but the context and usage differ between the two environments

```
import axios from 'axios';
 
// Make a GET request
axios.get('(link unavailable)')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
 
// Make a POST request
axios.post('(link unavailable)', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30
})
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
 
// Make a DELETE request
axios.delete('(link unavailable)')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```
 
**Example with async/await**
 
```
import axios from 'axios';
 
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('(link unavailable)');
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
 
fetchData();
```

Fetch and Axios are two popular libraries used for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Here's a brief comparison:
 
Fetch:
 
1. Built-in browser API (no need for external libraries)
2. Returns Promises
3. Supports modern JavaScript features like async/await
4. Simple and concise syntax
5. Supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
6. used only in angualr frontend side
 
Axios:
 
1. External library (needs to be installed via npm or CDN)
2. Returns Promises
3. Supports modern JavaScript features like async/await
4. More features and options compared to Fetch (e.g., interceptors, cancel tokens)
5. Supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
6. Can be used in Node.js environment (not just browser)
 
Key differences:
 
1. Fetch is a built-in API, while Axios is an external library.
2. Axios provides more features and options, making it a better choice for complex requests.
3. Fetch has a simpler syntax, making it a better choice for simple requests.
 
Choose Fetch when:
 
- You need a simple, built-in solution for making HTTP requests.
- You're working in a browser environment.
 
Choose Axios when:
 
- You need more features and options for complex requests.
- You're working in a Node.js environment or need more flexibility.

Here are some limitations of the Fetch API:
 
1. No support for canceling requests: Once a request is sent, it can't be canceled.
2. No support for timeouts: Fetch doesn't allow setting a timeout for requests.
3. Limited support for file uploads: Fetch doesn't support uploading files with additional data.
4. No support for progress tracking: Fetch doesn't provide a way to track upload or download progress.
5. Limited support for HTTP/2: Fetch doesn't fully support HTTP/2 features like multiplexing.
6. No built-in support for JSON data: Fetch returns raw responses, requiring manual JSON parsing.
7. Limited support for error handling: Fetch only returns a rejected Promise for network errors, not for HTTP errors.
8. No support for interceptors: Fetch doesn't allow modifying requests or responses globally.
9. Limited support for CORS: Fetch has limited control over CORS headers and behavior.
10. No support for Node.js environment: Fetch is primarily designed for browser use, not Node.js.

### httpClient

In Angular, you can use the HttpClient module to make HTTP requests. Here's an example:

```
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }    //_Inject HttpClient_

this.http.get('(link unavailable)')    //_Make a GET request_
  .subscribe(response => {
    console.log(response);
  });


//_Make a POST request_
const data = { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 };

this.http.post('(link unavailable)', data)
  .subscribe(response => {
    console.log(response);
  });


//_Make a DELETE request_

this.http.delete('(link unavailable)')

  .subscribe(response => {

    console.log(response);

  });

```
You can also use the `async/await` syntax with HttpClient:

```
async fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await this.http.get('(link unavailable)').toPromise();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

Remember to import the HttpClientModule in your app module:
```
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule],
})

export class AppModule { }

```
This is a basic example of using the HttpClient in Angular. You can find more information in the official Angular documentation.
